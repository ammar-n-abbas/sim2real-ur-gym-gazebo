1.4.2 (2016-06-16)
------------------
* New revision for ROS Package release.  Thanks to Gijs van der Hoorn

1.4.1 (2016-01-16)
------------------
* Fixed weird parsing issue with certain URDFs.

1.4.0 (2016-01-16)
------------------
* Added example program for using TRAC-IK.
* Added ability to get KDL chain structures from TRAC-IK class.

1.3.9 (2016-01-16)
------------------
* Added new TRAC-IK constructor that takes URDF location, base link, and tip
  link, instead of KDL structures.
* Some README fixes based on user comments

1.3.8 (2016-01-04)
------------------
* Fixed how continuous joints are handled in random restarts

1.3.7 (2016-01-04)
------------------
* Fixed bug introduced in 1.3.6 where tip frame was being used for Inverse
  Jacobian, which was never converging.

1.3.6 (2016-01-04)
------------------
* Fixed tolerances to be in tip frame, not base frame.
* Fixed Hydro compile issue
* Changed to std::numeric_limits for +/-FLT_MAX and epsilons
* Fixed potential error with URDF soft limits

1.3.5 (2015-12-08)
------------------
* Overhaul of how multiple solutions are managed in TRAC-IK threads.
* Improved speed and accurate returning of unique results found.

1.3.4 (2015-12-10)
------------------
* Fixed a bug where we were looping over solutions inside of looping over
  solutions. 

1.3.3 (2015-12-10)
------------------
* Change final normalization for manipulability metrics with continuous
  joints. Make continuous joints explicitly handled (if lower_limit >=
  upper_limit, joint is continuous).

1.3.2 (2015-12-10)
------------------
* Fixed bug where TRAC-IK multisolution modes weren't using the computed
  random seeds, but were using the same seed over and over.
* Fixed potential issues with large bound joints seraching too large of a
  space

1.3.1 (2015-12-08)
------------------
* Slight tweak to Manipulation metrics function to ensure it always works,
  even with weird Jacobians.

1.3.0 (2015-12-07)
------------------
* Added a mode to TRAC-IK constructor that determines how the IK solver
  runs: 1) Speed return immediately whenever any solution is found (all other
  modes run for the requested timeout to try to find multiple solutions); 2)
  Distance runs for the timeout and returns the solution found that minimizes
  the Sum-of-Squares error from the seed; 3) Manip1 returns the solution that
  maximizes the manipulation metric sqrt(det(J*J^T)); 4)  Manip2 returns the
  metric that minimizes the condition number J* J^-1.
* Added support for these modes in the MoveIt! plugin via the kinematic.yaml
  parameter solve_type, which can be one of the strings "Speed", "Distance",
  "Manipulation1", "Manipulation2".

1.2.1 (2015-12-07)
------------------
* Fixed a bug in the MoveIt! plugin FK call that assumed all joint poses were
  desired.


1.2.0 (2015-12-04)
------------------
* Extended TRAC-IK to both run in two ways: 1) the old mode of first IK
  solution found causes TRAC-IK to return immediately, versus 2) the new mode
  where TRAC-IK runs for the full requested timeout duration, then sorts all
  solutions according to distance from the seed and returns the minimum.
* Made MoveIt! support this new IK run mode if the user desires.
* Improved timing info to use a higher solution clock.
* Fixed TRAC-IK's abort/reset of KDL-RR and NLOpt-IK to catch race
  conditions.

1.1.2 (2015-12-3)
------------------
* Fixed issue where clamping a seed to be within the joint limits might still
  have values outside the limits.
* Fixed issue where MoveIt! plugin was not thread safe.
* Fixed an issue in MoveIt! plugin where error_code passed in uninitialized
  to SUCCESS could cause IK to say it failed when it did not.

1.1.1 (2015-11-19)
------------------
* Prepared code to have auto test suite run to generate data in main
  README.md.


1.1.0 (2015-11-12)
------------------
* Improvements to KDL-RR that better handle joint limits on rotational joints
  that can turn +- PI.
* Fixed bug where continuous joints could cause problems.
* Made NLOpt modes enums instead of integer parameters.


1.0.0 (2015-11-10)
------------------
* Initial checkin of TRAC-IK as of Humanoids 2015 submission.  Pulled from
  private repo.
* Made trac_ik packages conform to rosdep standards.
